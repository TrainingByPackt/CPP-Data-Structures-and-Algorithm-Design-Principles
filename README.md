# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms
C++ is a mature multi-paradigm programming language that enables you to write high-level code with a high degree of control over the hardware. Today, significant parts of software infrastructure, including databases, browsers, multimedia frameworks, and GUI toolkits, are written in C++.

This course starts by introducing C++ data structures and how to store data using linked lists, arrays, stacks, and queues. In later chapters, the course explains the basic algorithm design paradigms, such as the greedy approach and the divide-and-conquer approach, which are used to solve a large variety of computational problems. Finally, you will learn the advanced technique of dynamic programming to develop optimized implementations of several algorithms discussed in the course.

By the end of this course, you will have learned how to implement standard data structures and algorithms in efficient and scalable C++ 14 code.

### What you will learn
* Build applications using hashtables, dictionaries, and sets
* Implement a URL shortening service using a bloom filter
* Implement common algorithms, such as heap sort and merge sort in string data types
* Use C++ template metaprogramming to write code libraries
* Explore how modern hardware affects the actual run-time performance of programs
* Use appropriate modern C++ idioms like std:: array instead of C-style arrays

### The examples of this title has been implemented in the Windows/MAC/Linux operating system.

### Software Requirements
You'll also need the following software installed in advance:
*	Operating system: Windows 7 SP1 32/64-bit, Windows 8.1 32/64-bit, or Windows 10 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 14.04 or later, or macOS Sierra or later
*	Browser: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
*	Any modern compiler and IDE (optional) that supports the C++ 14 standard.
* Boost C++ Libraries
